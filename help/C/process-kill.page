  <title>Kill (close) a program immediately</title>

  <p>If a program stops working or freezes, you can force it to close ("kill" it) using <app>System Monitor</app>. Go to the <gui>Processes</gui> tab and click to select the process you want to kill. Then, click <gui>End Process</gui>.</p>
  
  <p>If the process does not close after a few seconds, right-click it and select <gui>Kill</gui> from the menu that appears.</p>
    
  <p>Using <gui>End Process</gui> tries to close the process properly, giving it time to save files and so on, whereas <gui>Kill</gui> forces it to close straight away. For some programs, this might mean that you lose unsaved files. You should always try <gui>End Process</gui> first.</p>
