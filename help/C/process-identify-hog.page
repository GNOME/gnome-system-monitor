    <p>Explain how the System Monitor can be used to find
    misbehaving/resource-hogging processes. (A lot of process use 100% CPU or
    similar if they hang, for example.)</p>
  </comment>

  <p>A program that is using more than its share of the CPU may slow down the
  whole computer. To find which process could be doing this:</p>

  <steps>	
    <item>
      <p>Click the <gui>Processes</gui> tab.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click the <gui>% CPU</gui> column header to sort the processes
      according to CPU use.</p>
      <note>
	<p>The arrow in the column header shows the sort direction; click again
        to reverse it. The arrow should point up.</p>
      </note>
   </item>
  </steps>

  <p>The processes at the top of the list are using the highest percentage CPU.
  Once you identify which one might be using more resources than it should, you
  can decide whether to close the program itself, or close other programs to
  try to reduce the CPU load.</p>

    <p>A process that has hung or crashed might use 100% CPU. If this happens
    you may need to <link xref="process-kill">kill</link> the process.</p>
