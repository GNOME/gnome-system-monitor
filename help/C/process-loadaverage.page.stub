  <title>What is the load average?</title>

    <p>Explain how to interpret the load averages quoted on the Processes tab.</p>
  </comment>

  <p>The <gui>load average</gui> shows the load on the CPU over three different
 time intervals, one minute, five minutes and fifteen minutes. These are displayed
 on the <gui>Processes</gui> tab above the process list, and are an indicator of
 system processing capacity.</p>

  <p>The <em>load</em> is the number of processes currently running plus the
 number of processes <em>queued</em> to run on the system's CPU(s). A load
 showing a utilization of 100% would be roughly 1.0 times the number of CPUs or
 <link xref="cpu-multicore">cores</link> in the system; load averages constantly
 hitting this number would indicate that the system is fully-loaded with no
 processes waiting for processor time. Lower numbers indicate that the system's
 processing power is sufficient for the processes being run, while numbers that
 are consistently higher might mean more processing power is needed.</p>

  <p>Three intervals are shown so that spikes and trends in the numbers can be
 taken into account: if the load average spikes higher in the one- or
 five-minute intervals, but settles down below the 100% mark over the
 fifteen-minute interval, system processing capacity is probably sufficient.</p>
