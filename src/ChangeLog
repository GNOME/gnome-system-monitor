	* proctable.c (sort_ints): handle case where ints are equal, 
	ensures that we maintain proper semantics for the sort function
	(that if a > b, b < a; if a and b are equal, the return val 
	can't depend on order the args are passed in)

2001-09-25  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	unthreadsafeness of some gnome functions.
	Also let the simple dialog share the gtk main loop instead of
	calling gnome_dialog_run. This makes it truly modeless

	* proctable.c: remove some unneeded commented stuff.

	settings if set. Also fix suitable defaults. Add command args
	to show the dialog

	Check to see if timeouts exist before removing them at app

	* interface.c: cosmetic improvements, put % in the graph
	titles to make explicit that it is the % that is being
	displayed

2001-09-06  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* favorites.c: add a little padding around the "remove from

	* interface.c: make disk frame label center align to be
	similar to the graph frame labels.

	* procdialogs.c: Make minimum timeout for proc view be 0.5

2001-09-03  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c: call load_graph_draw on the configure event. This
	removes the slight delay in drawing when switching tabs.

	* callbacks.c (cb_switch_page): remove the calls to load_graph_draw
	here since they did not help and the graph was not visible at that
	point so their effects were not noticable.

	* procman.c: make the default grid color a light green. Hopefully
	people dont' find it too ugly. Please someone provide me with a way
	to make a nice looking graph. I need help here. Pleeeease.

2001-09-03  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c: cosmetic improvements to the prefs dialog
	mainly making the two tabs have similar layouts.

2001-09-03  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c (create_kill_dialog): pass in the signal now
	so either SIGKILL or SIGTERM can use this dialog. Change the
	button labels accordingly.

	* callbacks.c: use the create_kill_dailog properly adding
	the signal to the argument.

	* interface.c: left align the disk name and mount point

	* util.c: fix a memory leak

2001-09-02  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c: improve the renice dialog by adding a label
	indicating whether the priority is high etc.

	* infoview.c: sync the priority label with that of the renice
	dialog

2001-09-01  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c (create_root_password_dialog) pass a gchar here
	as a argument for the dialog text. This way a seperate dialog
	asking if the user wants to enter the password is not needed. 
	Beautify the dialog a bit
	(create_renice_dialog) change the button to read Change Priority
	instead of renice.

	* procactions.c: pass the root password text to 
	create_root_passsword_dialog

2001-08-31   Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: left justify the disk name and mount point
	clist entries.
	
	* procactions.c: do the su stuff on renice. Slightly different
	error message for when the user does not have permission or
	when they have permission but try to lower the nice value.

	* procactions.c (renice): pass procdata in here in order to 
	pass it to the password dialog.

	* procdialogs.c (renice_accept): pass procdata ro renice

2001-08-31  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c: add notebook tab for process viewer and
	system monitor settings. Add settings for graph colors, and
	graph/disk update intervals.

	* callbacks.c: change gpointer to a procdata instead of the clist
	so that you don't have to access the clist to use this function
	anywhere in the code. The clist is now stored in procdata.

	* interface.c: pass procdata to cb_update_disks

	* load_graph.c: change back to 2 pixel line width

	* prettytable.c: remove some debugging stuff. 
	(prettytable_load_async) return if thread could not be created.

	* procman.[c,h]: add config variable for disk update interval.
	Add to ProcInfo structure booleans if process is thread and
	if it has a .desktop file.

	* proctable.c: some reordering of the code initiated by the fact that
	(thread) was not being added anymore. A benefit is that we don't
	call prettytable_get_icons more than needed.
	(update_info): don't try to get icon or name if it has already
	been checked (info->has_desktop_file is either 0 or 1). Be
	sure to readd (thread) if the name has changed.
	(get_info): check to see if process is a thread here and set
	info->is_thread accordingly. 
	Set has_desktop_file to 0 or 1 if the desktop files have been
	scanned at this point.
	(insert_info_to_tree): now add process to info->parent_node
	if it has a parent. Don't show if info->is_thread = FALSE and
	we are not supossed to show threads.

2001-08-28  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* prettytable.c (pretty_table_add_table): fix memory leak.
	gnome_datadir_file return string should be freed. Add
	$prefix/applets to the search directories to get some icons
	for the applets

2001-08-28  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c: add line divisions to the graph. Make the data
	lines wider (3 pixels - maybe too large).

	* proctable.c: add hack to see if process is graphical. Check
	the memory maps to see if it links to libX11. #ifdefed out
	right now - not sure if it is too useful

2001-08-27  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* infoview.c, callbacks.c, load-graph.c: mark the memory size
	strings for translation. bug #59597

2001-08-27  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* callbacks.c: mark the author strings for translation
	Fixes bug #59595.

2001-08-26  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c: connect to "close" signal for renice dialog.
	Don't popup a new dialog if another already exists.

	* favorites.c: again connect to "close" signal, and only
	do gnome_dialog_close if the close button is pressed.

2001-08-25  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Fix bug #59548 by only showing utf8 names for the e-tree
	* procman.h: add name_utf8 string to ProcInfo structure

	* proctable.c (get_name): do the utf8 thing on the name for the
	name_utf8 string and g_strdup the name for the info->name
	(proctable_get_value): return info->name_utf8 here instead
	of info->name.

2001-08-25  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* memmaps.c: connect to the "close" signal since "destroy" was
	causing corruption when save the e-tree state file. Try to
	raise the dialog if it already exists. For the close button
	just call gnome_dialog_close, don't call it in the "close" 
	signal handler. Clear the memmaps data at close time

2001-08-24  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: add a Kill Process item to right click
	menu because there are times when it is needed.

	* procactions.c (kill_process): add an extra argument to
	determine the signal sent.

	* callbacks.c: add popup_menu_end_process to send SIGTERM and
	change popup_menu_kill_process to send SIGKILL and ignore the
	warning dialog.

	* procdialogs.c: call kill_process with SIGTERM.

2001-08-24  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: Put disks updating on timeout. Move mount 
	directory to the last column of the clist since it is the 
	least interesting.

	* procman.[c,h]: new config value for the graph updating
	interval. Remove the g_free to the e-tree state save file
	names since I think that may be why procman leaves behind
	weird files.

	* load-graph.c: use the new timeout config variable for the
	graph timeout.

	* callbacks.c (cb_update_disks): clear the clist and
	repopulate.

2001-08-24  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: fix bug #59466, a typo in wording. Also slightly
	modify another string. Sorry translators :(

2001-08-23  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: connect to the "delete_event" signal as that
	is more right than "destroy" and gets rid of the bug where
	widgets are destroyed before the "destroy" signal is emitted.

	* callbacks.c: now cb_app_delete for the "delete_event" signal
	and cb_exit for the exit menu item.

2001-08-23  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: fill in the status bar message for the menuitems

2001-08-23  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c: make the graph one pixel smaller than the frame
	so it always shows up.
	Initialize the data points to -1 and then don't display them.
	
2001-08-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: make the graphs above each other to display
	more history.

	* load-graph.c: move the frame back behind the data. Do a crude
	hack to check if the data has any value and don't draw a line
	if not so. Gets rid of the line having to do with the fact that
	the data for time periods before the app started is zero. Bump
	the number of points up since we now have more space.

2001-08-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: add a new column to the disks showing used space.
	center justify each element in the disk list.

	* procman.c: add default colors

2001-08-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Ability to save colors

	* procman.h: the config variables for the colors are now
	GdkColors

2001-08-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Some UI to change the cpu/mem/swap colors. Still need to
	save to disk though

	* callbacks.c cb_[cpu,mem,swap]_color_changed: callback for
	the gnome color pickers, change the current colors

	* interface.c: add the color pickers. Add the swap used label
	as a caption to the now Memory / Swap graph.

	* load-graph.c: # of colors is now g->n + 2 ie one for each
	graphed item, one for background and one for frame. Draw frame
	after data so it is on top. calculate swap in get_memory

	* procman.c: new config variable for the swap color.

	* procman.h: move the LoadGraph structure here.

2001-08-21  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Configurable colors for the graphs. Need to add UI in the
	settings dialog still.
	* procman.[c,h]: add config values for colors

	* callbacks.c: add a FIXME about using gnome_url_show

	* interface.c: update the calls to loag_graph_new
	passing the colors

	* load_graph.c: do the color dance

2001-08-21  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: change the "" to NULL in the UIINFOs as that
	seemed to cause problems

2001-08-20  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c: fix the bug where the graph would initialize the data
	on first view. Save the old data in the update not in the drawing.
	Chnage the g_return_if_fail to a regular return since I know
	why this routine is called after disp is NULL and it is harmless. 

	* util.c: remove some ddebugging stuff

	* procdialogs.c: make the entry default to focus, and the enter
	button be default

	* interface.c: make the frame labels for the cpu and mem graphs
	be centered

2001-08-19  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* util.c: get the root stuff working! No need to do an extra
	fork. The problem was that exit was being called earlier on
	the parent process. Now only call exit on the child. Release
	coming soon.

2001-08-19  Tige Chastain (tigechastain@home.com)

	* favorites.c: Added checking to empty hidden processes window.

2001-08-19  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* util.c: call fork before execlp so the procman doesn't quit
	when you kill the process

2001-08-19  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* util.c: new misc file. Contains the exec as root stuff for
	now

	* procactions.c: do the root dialog on kill if permission denied.
	Update some strings

	* procdialogs.c (create_root_password_dialog): new dialog to
	get the root password

2001-08-18  Tige Chastain <tigechastain@home.com>

	* procactions.c: provide feedback when renice and kill don't
	work.

2001-08-18  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c (load_graph_draw): put a g_return_val_if_fail
	on the main window to deal with a crash on exit.
	Slow the update down for a better display. Need to not hardcode
	these values.

	* interface.c: some update of the labels.

	* callbacks.c: end the timers on exit. The load_graph_draw
	is still being called even after the window has been 
	destroyed.

2001-08-18  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* callbcaks.c: remove cb_progress_meter... Force a graph update
	upon a tab switch.

	* interface.c: update some of the labels for the cpu and mem
	graphs. Also don't show a disk if it has zero size - seems to 
	do the work of not showing /proc etc.

	* load-graph.c (load_graph_draw): not static anymore so the 
	graph can be drawn in callbacks.c. Set the graph width and height
	here so we are always guarenteed the allocation->[height,width] are
	correct. 
	(get_memory): put in the memory values for the labels

	* proctable.c: add a FIXME and remove the progress meter stuff.

2001-08-17  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c (get_size_string): display the disk space sizes nicer.

	* callbacks.c: remove some debugging stuff.

	* load-graph.c: draw a coordinate axis

2001-08-17  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: add a clist to show mounted disks. 

	* load-graph.c (load_graph_[start,stop]): make it so data
	is continually taken but don't do the drawing untill a call
	to load_graph_start. Thus switching back and forth the data
	will remain.

2001-08-16  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Beginnings of graphical display of cpu history and mem usage.
	Remove the cpu/mem/swap meters from the main window and add
	back the app-bar. Now there are two notebook tabs for 
	the process list and the sys monitor

	* callbacks.c (cb_switch_page): new callback when the tab is
	switched. Turn off the process updating or cpu/mem updating
	when relevant.
	
	* interface.c: seperate the process tab UI from the sysmon. Add
	them as seperate tabs.

	* procman.[c,h]: add new gint config variable indicating the
	current tab

	* load-graph.[c,h]: code stolen and modified from the multiload
	applet.

2001-08-14  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* proctable.c (proctable_search_table): put up an error message
	if the search string was not found.

2001-08-13  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* proctable.c (proctable_update_progress_bars): save the 
	last % CPU and average it with the new pcpu to get a smoother
	display.

	* interface.c: make the cpu meter timeout be faster

2001-08-13  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* infoview.c: chnage "nice value" to "priority" though still
	display priority as "High ( Nice -10 )". Set the tooltip delay
	to be shoter so as to be more noticable

	* interface.c: again change Nice to priority. Add underscores to
	all the menu items. Change window titile to be "Procman System
	Monitor".

	* procdialogs.c: Improve the renice dialog. Use an hscale, put
	a frame around it. Pressing renice button closes the dialog so
	a cancel button is more appropriate

2001-08-07 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c : move the popup menu callbacks back to
	callbacks.c. Add a new menuitem to get info about the
	process. Just tries to man:process name.

	* callbacks.c (popup_menu_about_process): call gnome_url_show
	on the process command name. Perhaps there is a better way.

	* proctable.c (get_process_name): change this to get the
	process name and process command. Thus shortened command names
	should no longer be in procman.

2001-08-07 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c (create_main_window): hook up to the key press
	signal for the e-tree. Also remove a duplicated 
	gtk_signal_connect for the "right_click" signal.

	* callbacks.c (cb_tree_key_press): toggle info tab if 
	return/enter or space bar is pressed

2001-08-07 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* proctable.c (get_process_nmae): strip the path from the
	arguments string. Now process name show in their full glory.
	(get_info): remove unneeded stuff
	(update_info): update the name just as if icon needs updateing.

	* procactions.c (kill_process): fix spelling of SIGTERM.

	* prettytable.c (...get_name): return NULL if the process does
	not have a .desktop file. 

2001-08-06 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* proctable.c (get_process_name): new function to get the name.
	Will try to get name from arguments string.

	* interface.c (popup_menu...): declare them as static functions
	because, well.., that's what they are.

2001-08-06 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* Makefile.am: add procactions.c procactions.h

	* procactions.[c,h]: new file to deal with process actions
	like renice and kill

	* callbacks.c (end_process_button...): use the kill function

	* interface.c (popup...kill_process): use the kill function here
	also. Do the warning also if needed.
	
	* procdialogs.c (create_kill_dialog): show the dialog here instead
	of returnin the dialog GtkWidget

	* procdialogs.c (cb_kill..._clicked): use the new kill function.
	(renice_accepted): use the new renice function.
	(create_renice_dialog): change cancel button the close

2001-08-05 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Improve the popup menu from patch by Tige Chastain 
	<tigechastain@home.com>

	* interface.c (create_main_window): create the popup menu here
	and save as a global variable. Make the menu nicer.
	(do_popup_menu): rename to avoid conflict with said global
	variable. Now just pop the menu up
	(popup_menu*): place callbacks here and call gtk_popdown_menu
	on the global GtkMenu.

2001-08-05 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procman.c: add new boolean config option to do the delay load
	(procman_get_data): do the delay loading here and honor the
	new config option. Add a timeout to determine if the icons are
	loaded.
	(icon_load_finished): timeout function. Update the table once
	loading is finished.

	* procman.h: renmae config variable show_icons to 
	load_desktop_files to be more descriptive.

	* proctable.c (update_info): check to see if process name
	needs updating

2001-08-05 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* e-clipped-lable.[c,h]: stolen from evolution. Displays
	labels shortened with ...

	* infoview.c: make the command label an e-clipped-label.
	(infoview_update): display the command arguments for the 
	command label instead of just the command itself.

2001-08-04 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs (create_pref_dialgo): comment out never_show_icons 
	prefernece

	* interface (create_main_window): make infobox above the buttons
	at the bottom of window. Looks better to me 

2001-08-04 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* callbacks.c (cb_end_process): changed SIGTERM to SIGKILL

	* procdialogs.c: likewise.

	* prettytable.c (prettytable_load_async): new function to get 
	the icons using a seperate thread.
	(thread_func): new function to actually load the icons within
	the thread.

	* interface.c (idle_func): call the new async functions to load
	icons

	* proctable.c (update_info): check to see if icon doesn't exist
	and if so try to find one. Not ideal in that it means we 
	constantly check for icons for processes that don't have them.

	* prettytable.h: remove unneeded stuf

	* procman.c (procman_data_new): change default "view as" to 
	my processes.

2001-08-04 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	First crack at delay loading icons.

	* interface.c (create_main_window): create an idle timer to delay 
	load the icons
	(idle_func): test the delay loading. Should probably create a
	thread to load the icons to prevent blocking

	* procman.c (procman_data_new): don't load icons here

Sat Aug  4 00:35:55 2001  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	(fill_tree_with_info): new function to fill the tree.
	(remove_item): remove the call to e_tree_memory_node_remove
	as that caused a segfault in e-tree that won't be fixed for
	Gal 1.0
	(remove_button_clicked): call the e-tree ForEach function so
	all selected processes are remove from the list. Then call
	fill_tree_with_info to clear the tree and repopulate.

	* memmaps.c (clear_memmaps): free the info->flags string to fix
	a memory leak.

	* procman.c (procman_free_data): free strings pointing to
	.etspec files. Fixes memory leak.

	* proctable.c (get_info): remove unused variable and some 
	unneeded comments

2001-08-03 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procman.h: add new gchar to ProcInfo structure for the command
	args

	* proctable.c (get_info): get the command arguments

	* infoview.c: new tooltip for the command label showing the
	full arguments. Wrap the command label in an event box.
	(infoview_update): update the tooltip but make sure that
	the selected process has changed otherwise updating the
	tooltip will make it go away.

	* procman.h: add new gint for the progress meter timeouts
	so they can be removed at app destruction

	* callbacks.c (cb_app_destroy): remove the timeouts. I think
	they were still being triggered even though the widgets were
	destroyed.

2001-08-02 Tige Chastain <tigechastain@home.com>

	* interface.c (create_main_window): hook up to the "right-click"
	signal for popup menu.

	by calling popup_menu.

2001-08-02 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* proctable.c, memmaps.c: do a stat for the .etspec file. Bail out
	with error dialog if its not found

	* interface.c, procman.c: bail out if the e-tree could not
	be created

2001-08-01 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* prettytable.[c,h]: add new hash table to search ,.desktop name
	entry. Now nautilus gets its proper name.

	* defaulttable.h: upper case gnome-session

2001-08-01 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* prettytable.c (prettytable_load_path): return a g_strdown
	since it is a key and will not be dislplayed

2001-07-31 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

        * procman.h: add boolean to ProcInfo indicating whether
        the process is blacklisted.

        * proctable.c (update_info): insert process and remove taking
        into account whether it was formerly blacklisted or not. Fixes
        a bug where a process was continusouly inserted leading
        to (thread) being appended over and over

        * procdialogs.c (creare_preferences_dialog): update comment
        to be correct.

        * infoview.c (create_infoview): cosmetic improvements

        * prettytable.c (_load_path): remove g_strdowns so app names
        will be upper case per Seth's suggestion. Nautilus doesn't
        get an icon so I need to check into that.

2001-07-31  Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@gnome-db.org>

	* proctable.c, favorites.c: Please, remember to add the
	config.h include. Thanks ;-)

	memory at exit.

	* proctable.c (proctable_free_table): new function to free
	the process list.

2001-07-30 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	*proctable.c (proctable_get_value): use

2001-07-12 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	For now don't do the favorites. Instead make a blacklist
	of processes the user don't want to see. I think this is
	more useful than defining favorites.

	*proctable.c: remove favorites for now since I'm not sure
	if it is usefule. Instead there will be a blacklist of
	processes that the user doesn't want to see.

	*favorites.c: add stuff for blacklisting processes similar to
	favorites stuff.

	*proctable.c (proctable_new): check to see that the tree
	is created from the spec file and bail out if not.

	widths and add memmaps.etspec

2001-07-10 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Carlos Perello Marin <carlos@gnome-db.org> for
	providing the initial patch.

	Also make the More Info and Less Info labels saner
	and make sure if the info is already shown at startup set the
	label to Less Info.

	causing a crash. Also add the term (thread) to any thread
	processes.

	setting certain widgets insensitive at startup, just send 
	an "unselect" signal.

	*interface.c: add menu items for renice and memory maps.

	*memmaps.c: changed cmd_label to command_label since I used
	the same variable in the infoview.

	No UI to change it but one can do that in the .gnome 
	configuration file.

	variable to show the tree. Also check to see if parent process
	has same memory total as well as same name to deterimine if it
	is a thread.

2001-07-05 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	*proctable.c (remove_children_from_tree): remove the 
	e_tree_memory_node_remove call as it seems to cause some
	infinite looping.

	to inprove table updating. Add glibtop_free to fix a major
	memory leak.

	should probably not be hard coded.

	*procman.c (main): remove the push visual and colormap since
	I don't know what use they are for.

	*procman.h, proctable.c: change ETreePath *path to ETreePath path
	since they should not be declared as pointers.
